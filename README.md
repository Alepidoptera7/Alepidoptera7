Hello Biological World! 

I'm Andrew Lamothe, a bioinformatic engineer, but most people call me Quin. 

I hold bachelor's degrees in Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics, and Computational Mathematics from UCSC. 

I'm currently pursing a Masters of Engineering from UC Berkeley in Bioengineering - Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. 

My primary interests pertain to the development of bioinformatic APIs and machine learning based methods of biological system and therapeutic molecule prediction. 

Please, inspect my work such that we advance together!
