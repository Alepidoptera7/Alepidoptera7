Hello Biological World,

I'm Quin Lamothe, a bioinformatic engineer. My efforts involve programming in Python, R and JavaScript as may be applied to laboratory processes, clinical discovery, therapeutic design, and bioinformatic web development. 

I'll soon finish a Masters of Engineering at UC Berkeley in Bioengineering - Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, with a Dean's Scholarship. I hold bachelor's degrees in Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics, and Computational Mathematics from UCSC, with honors. 

Please, inspect my work, such that we may converge on truth together.
